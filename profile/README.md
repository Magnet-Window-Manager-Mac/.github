Magnet is a window management application for macOS that simplifies workspace organization by allowing users to snap windows to specific positions on the screen. This productivity tool helps maximize screen real estate and improve workflow efficiency through intuitive window arrangement. The application supports both drag-and-drop snapping and customizable keyboard shortcuts for quick window positioning.

This window management software enables users to organize multiple applications side by side with precision alignment. Magnet supports snapping windows to halves, quarters, thirds, and full-screen positions with smooth animations. The application remembers window positions and can restore previous layouts when reconnecting external displays or changing workspace configurations.

The keyboard shortcut system in Magnet provides instant access to all window positioning options without using the mouse. Users can customize shortcuts to match their workflow preferences and muscle memory. The application integrates seamlessly with macOS mission control and spaces features, enhancing the native window management capabilities of the operating system.

For power users and multitaskers, Magnet offers advanced features like center window positioning, moving windows between displays, and specific arrangements for ultrawide monitors. The software works with all types of applications including web browsers, document editors, design tools, and development environments. Lightweight and efficient, Magnet runs quietly in the background without impacting system performance.
